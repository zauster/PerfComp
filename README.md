Performance Comparisons of Nonlinear Solver
====================

This is part of an ongoing project at university, where I try to find
efficient ways to solve large nonlinear systems. More exactly, large
nonlinear systems that may originate from a CGE (Computable General
Equilibrium) Model in economics.
